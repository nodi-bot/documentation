# Stop Cluster

## Definition

A **stopCluster** is a collection of **[stopGroups](./stop-group.md)**. It corresponds to a user intent. It is often illustrated by a city, but it can be anything the user is supposed to be looking for.

## Example

"Paris" is a **stopCluster**.

```json
{
  "id": "c|FRparis___@u09tv",
  "name": "Paris",
  "city": "Paris",
  "region": "ÃŽle-de-France",
  "country": "FR",
  "latitude": 48.8566,
  "longitude": 2.3515
  //...
}
```
